# ChromeBookAutomation
Scripts used for automation of processes involving Chromebook management.

This repisotiry contains several scripts used in the management, setup, and assignment of Chromebooks for an organization.

How all of these scripts work together can be found in "Summer Workflow.docx" in the top level of the reposoitory.

All links and named referneces to proproietary software have been removed from my documentation and scripts for protection of the organization.
