This script is written for Google Apps Script (Javascript) to automatically change a list of Chromebooks (by serial number) to a different Organizational Unit.

Google Apps Script does not allow scripts to be exported in a readable format which is why the code is provided in a text file.

Each Chromebook's serial number is entered in a Google Sheet so the script can loop through each row and change the Chromebook to the apropriate OU.

See the .docx file in this same directory for directions on using the script.
