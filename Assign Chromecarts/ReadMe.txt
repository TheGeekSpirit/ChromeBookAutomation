This script automaitcally assigns Chromecarts to their respective rooms in an inventory management system (IMS). This script was exported to an .exe for ease of use by others at the company.

This is accomplished by placing the serial number of each Chromebook within the cart in a .CSV with the same name as the room it is being assigned to.

The script recieves input for login credentials to the IMS and then navigates to the proper menu to upload each file with the list of Chromebooks to assign to each room.

See .docx file in same directory for instructions of using this script.
